# Next.js 15 App Router Link Component Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using Next.js 15's App Router with `next/link` component.  The issue involves unexpected behavior and inability to navigate to the correct routes using the links within a component.

## Bug Description
The links within the `MyComponent` do not navigate to the expected pages.  This problem can occur with different link structures. See `bug.js` for a minimal reproducible example. 

## Solution
The solution typically involves checking the following:
1. **Correct route definitions:** Ensure your routes are correctly defined in the `app` directory.
2. **Link structure:** Double-check the `href` props in your `Link` components to ensure they accurately point to the desired pages.  Be mindful of leading slashes or incorrect paths.
3. **`next/navigation`:** Consider using the `next/navigation` package for more control over navigation.
4. **Layout and components:** If using layouts, verify the hierarchy is not interfering with the linking behavior.
5. **Conflicting Packages:** Ensure that there are no conflicting packages interfering with Next.js navigation.

Please refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for a possible fix and alternative approach with the updated navigation package.
